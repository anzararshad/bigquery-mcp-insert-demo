# üß™ BigQuery Data Writer - MCP server 

This project utilizes the [Model Context Protocol Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), which allows us to create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on our end. Using this setup, we can enable Claude to generate sample data and automatically insert it into Google BigQuery tables.

The MCP server facilitates interactions between Claude and BigQuery, enabling seamless data insertion and table creation for rapid prototyping and testing.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

- Let Claude create BigQuery tables with custom schemas
- Allows Claude to insert data directly into those tables
- Great for generating test data, prototyping ideas, or populating sample datasets for LLM/RAG training and experimentation

---

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled
- A service account key with BigQuery access
- Claude Desktop installed and running locally

---

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anzararshad/bigquery-mcp-insert-demo.git
   cd bigquery-mcp-insert-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies using [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up your Google Cloud service account:

   - Create a service account with BigQuery Admin/Editor roles
   - Download the JSON key file
   - Save it in a `secret/` folder and configure the path in `main.py`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `main.py` to add your project and dataset info:

```python
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
DATASET_ID = "your-bigquery-dataset"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = "./secret/your-service-account-key.json"
```

Ensure the dataset exists in your project. Create it via the BigQuery Console or CLI if not.

---

## üèÉ Running the MCP Server

To register the BigQuery writer tool with Claude:

```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```

Expected output:

```
INFO     Added server 'BigQueryReadWriter' to Claude config
INFO     Successfully installed BigQueryReadWriter in Claude app
```

This means the MCP server is now available to Claude Desktop.

## ü§ñ Example Prompt to Use with Claude

Ask Claude to create and populate a table using this kind of prompt:

```
I‚Äôm working on a dataset around tech startups and their funding history. Can you generate a sample data row for startups that recently raised funding?

Please respond in JSON format with these fields:
* "table_id": a string for the BigQuery table name.
* "schema": a list of columns, where each column is a JSON object with:
   * "name": the column name
   * "type": BigQuery data type (STRING, INT64, FLOAT64, BOOL, TIMESTAMP, etc.)
   * "description": a short description of the column
* "data": a single JSON object with values that match the schema.

Include fields like:
- startup_name
- industry
- funding_stage (like Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.)
- amount_raised_usd
- lead_investor
- founded_year
- is_profitable (boolean)
- headquarters_country
- funding_date (timestamp)

Note: Project ID and dataset are already configured, no need to include them.

```

Claude will then:
- Define a schema
- Generate mock data
- Call the `BigQueryReadWriter` tool via MCP
- Create the table and insert the data into BigQuery üéØ

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues where your Google Cloud packages are not packaged into the `claude_desktop_config.json`, you may need to add them manually by updating your `claude_desktop_config.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "BigQueryReadWriter": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli],google-cloud-bigquery,google-auth,google-api-python-client",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/Users/arshad1996/bigquery-mcp-insert-demo/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to change the path to your `main.py` file and add the necessary Google Cloud packages in the `args` section. I ran into this issue sometimes, and this manual update solved it.

## üß† Why I Built This

As someone who works with both data and ML, I often need sample datasets to test pipelines, train models, or prep for a RAG setup. Instead of manually writing mock data every time, I figured ‚Äî why not ask Claude to generate it for me, *and* push it into BigQuery directly?

This tool saves me time, and maybe it‚Äôll save you some too. Feel free to fork, tweak, and adapt it to your needs. Drop a ‚≠ê if it helps you!
